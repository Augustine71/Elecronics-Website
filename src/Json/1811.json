            "ans":"Yes, they are worthwhile, mainly if you are interested in fitness or travel. Wireless earphones have become much more affordable in recent years. The absence of wires allows for a more excellent range of motion and connectivity with a wide range of devices."
        },
        {
            "que":"What is the lifespan of wireless earbuds?",
            "ans":"You should get roughly two years out of cheap or average-quality earbuds. Best wireless earbuds can endure for four or five years if appropriately purchased. Furthermore, earbuds have a 2 - 4 year average lifespan."
        },
        {
            "que":"Which is better, earbuds or AirPods?",
            "ans":"The most noticeable difference between traditional EarPods and the new AirPods would be that the AirPods are entirely wireless, while the EarPods are not. For those who had problems keeping the connected EarPods on their ears, the new AirPods are the solution."
        },
        {
            "que":"Can wireless earbuds be used individually?",
            "ans":"True wireless earphones still use Bluetooth technology, but instead of being incorporated into a wire, the Bluetooth connection is built directly into each earpiece. Because the earbuds are distinct, you may use each separately or join them together for a more immersive music experience."
